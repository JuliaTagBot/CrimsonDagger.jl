# CrimsonDagger

CrimsonDagger is a scheduler plugin to the Dagger.jl framework, which is based
on the default Dagger scheduler "Sch". This plugin is both a staging ground for
changes which are yet to be upstreamed to Dagger.Sch, as well as a place where
fancier features may thrive that aren't suitable for upstreaming.
